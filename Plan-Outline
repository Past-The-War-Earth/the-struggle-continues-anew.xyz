# Plan Outline

By 2028 complete:

* Detailed plans for implementation of NLNM (Non-Lethal, Non-Mutilating, No Serious Injury) combat. It must successfully prove the feasibility of implementation of NLNM combat on a concrete schedule.

* Based on analysis, create:

1. A detailed goal based roadmap.
2. Detailed level proposal 3 stages with full implementation.  
3. Schedule adjustable based on the goals reached in the roadmap.

Timeframe boundaries:

1. Conservative estimate:  Starting from 2028 - periods of 33, 33 and 34 years with the target year of 2128.
2. Aggressive estimate:  Starting this year - periods of 13 to 16 years with the target years between 2065 and 2075.

The tree stages are:

1. Partial implementation of (disabling adhesive) projective based (modern) NLNM combat - coincides with the current global rearmament cycle.
2. Expansion of projectile based NLNM combat. Partial implementation of mechanized-traditional based NLNM combat - enabled by continued technological progress.
3. Mass adoption of projectile based NLNM combat. Expansion of mechanized-traditional based NLNM combat. Partial implementation of Mech-based combat (zoned to evacuated industrial and strategic zones) - enabled by extanded industrial capacity.
  
* Create a realistic working simulation of tactical combat up to regiment level.
