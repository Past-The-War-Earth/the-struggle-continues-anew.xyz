## No Serious Injury configuration

1. To prevent permanent head and spine damage and to minimize organ damage gloved combatants should be fully armored except for the frontal torso (below collar bone and under pit structural connectors, and above belt level) and arms. A  civilian (mass) signal equivalent of such armor are variably-opened, short sleeved shirts. Around-the-shoulder areas should be exposed to prevent any force augmentation of arms.

2. Helmets should have hard outside shells and internal active impact dampening. In the spirit of contemporary automotive seat belts, structural arrangement should create a full body brace in case of high velocity impact to the head.  Head bracing should demotivate any excessive impact to the head.

3. To prevent glove hardening or force augmentation standard boxing-like gloves should be required by international rules of engagement.  When possible an arbitrating party (possibly in the form of monitoring and supply drones) should distribute gloves immediately prior to mutually organized battles and monitor glove equipment and subsequent usage.

4. Helmet and shoulder shaping and surfacing should prevent gloved pulls of opponents upper torso towards a lower body attack.  Lower armor weight and construction should further naturally prevent effective lower body usage for blunt impact to the frontal torso or head, while allowing for boxing-like adjility in stance changes.

## Defensive formations

1. Lower back, belt and below armor should be heavily reinforced and braced to support several shield weights. Lower armor can be power-assisted when shields are attached to the back.  Shield sensors and helmet Augmented Reality vision should enable through-shield combat awareness when shield is carried in frontal defensive formations, or in shield structures.

2. Shields are to be near-rhombus shaped with configurable extensions to a rectangle or be otherwise sufficiently adjustable. Shields should be able to form a structurally ideal, impact-preventing dome or a functionally alike structure. Battlefield defensive structures should be supported at least at squad level with 7 side and 2 top shields or a functionally equivalent formation. Platoon and company size shielding and anchoring structures should be possible with advanced shield interlinking and adaptive structural supports. A non-combat usage of larger structures is mobile barracks.

## Mobility

1. Powered and ground impact augmented lower body armor greatly improves battlefield formation maintenance and ground control. In conjunction with sufficient shield power bank capacity and solar charging surfaces, powered armor enables organized and rapid cross-field advancement, maneuvering and retreats.  In case of temporary gloved combatant incapacitation such as exhaustion or sleep, leg armor could literally move him, the brace configuration of the armor could keep him upright, and armor automation and sensors could direct him.

2. Self-powered and variable-level autonomous armor movement greatly simplify battlefield evacuation of injured combatants in a significant portion of possible cases, greatly reducing time to medical facility airlift or movement away from blunt impact zone towards a medic for aid application.

## Training 

Impact area limitations and armor assistance sufficiently reduce required skill level for blunt impact readiness of recruits for short term service durations of a year or two years.

## Battlefield control

Overall battlefield organization and control of hand-to-hand combat is greatly increased.
