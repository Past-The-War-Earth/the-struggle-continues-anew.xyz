# Higher (range) systematic analysis

Added: 2/27/2025

1. All short term contingent armor and mounted officer armor is modular medium personal, multi-level automated armor.  Gloved combatant armor has arm and frontal torso sections detached.  Projectile force armor has the throw/draw arm sections detached.  Battlefield medic and mounted officer armor has all sections, with medical equipment.

2. All armor across all classes is immune to adhesive projectiles.  The exposed areas of combatant bodies are vulnerable to adhesive projectiles. Mounts/horses are armored and are immune to adhesive projectiles.  NLNM mode mount shoes and horse hooves are vulnerable to adhesive projectiles.  All armor resists conventional projectile and energy payloads.

3. Shields store energy in energy rapid release and capture capacitors.  They are capable of generating active, targeted electro-magnetic fields to repel projectiles and can capture energy payloads (a la regenerative shields).  In defensive dome or equivalent formations shielding and capacitor capabilities grow proportionally with increasing number of interlinked shields.

4. All medium armor is identical in hardware capabilities and has modular, NLNM and technological warfare enabled software capabilities.  All helmets have full communication and Augmented Reality capabilities.  In technological combat mode, targeting, path projection and engagement prediction and multi-level automation is universally enabled. In NLNM mode targeting and related capabilities are enabled for the projectile force.  Armor and body scanning and physical condition analysis are universally enabled.

5. All armor hardware is enabled for high accuracy targeting of all ranged weaponry and momentum augmentation of adhesive and modern projectiles.  Armor movement velocity, momentum change capabilities and variable-level automation differ based on armor class.  Arm and upper segments of medium armor have various built in or attached weapon and shielding configurations. 

6. With wide understanding and acceptance, civilian setting signaling can be used for public opinion polls.  Wearing a collar shirt indicates participation in polls.  Fully buttoned shirts signify readiness or preference for technological combat (given specific informational setting).  Standard top-button undone signifies neutral position.  Increase in the number of undone buttons indicates progressively higher readiness or preference for NLNM combat.  Short-sleeve shirts indicate preference for controlled gloved combat.  Long-sleeve shirts indicate preference for commissioned and noncommissioned officer-only combat.  Full suit indicates preference for commissioned officer-only combat.  Further clothing signal arrangements indicating readiness or preferences for mixed level combat or other combat or maneuvering combinations are possible.
