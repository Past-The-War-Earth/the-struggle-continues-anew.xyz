# Plan Outline

By 2028 complete:

* Detailed plan for implementation of NLNM (Non-Lethal, Non-Mutilating, No Serious Injury) combat. It must successfully prove the feasibility of implementation of NLNM combat on a concrete schedule.

* Based on produced analysis, create:

1. A detailed goal based roadmap.
2. Detailed level proposal 3 stages with full implementation.  
3. Schedule adjustable based on the goals reached in the roadmap.

Timeframe boundaries:

1. Conservative estimate:  Starting from 2028 - periods of 33, 33 and 34 years with the target year of 2128.
2. Aggressive estimate:  Starting this year - periods of 13 to 16 years with the target years between 2065 and 2075.

The tree stages are:

1. Partial implementation of (disabling adhesive) projective based (modern) NLNM combat - coincides with the current global rearmament cycle.
2. Expansion of projectile based NLNM combat. Partial implementation of mechanized-traditional based NLNM combat - enabled by continued technological progress.
3. Mass adoption of projectile based NLNM combat. Expansion of mechanized-traditional based NLNM combat. Partial implementation of (remotely controlled via quantum entanglement controlled) Mech-based combat (zoned to evacuated industrial and strategic zones) - enabled by extanded industrial capacity.

## General time frame:

1. The first dimension of the Timeline of NLNM implementation will be technological progress and the associated increase in resource abundance.  The measuring factors are implementation of Nuclear Fusion Industry and Robotization.
2. The hypothesized second dimention is the societal progress to intra-society No Theat of Violence, associated with the resource abundance and the changed way of life.

## Simulation
  
For visualization purposes, by Spring 2031 create a limited, realistic simulation of tactical NLNM ground combat with command-only (Augmented Reality) controls at platoon, company, battalion and regiment commander level.
