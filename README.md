## Unintentional acronym association:

EN - [CSKA](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=CSKA+clubs&title=Special%3ASearch&ns0=1&searchToken=5knw0wi4qzkqhvcp11essn6p6) , RU - [ЦСКА](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A6%D0%A1%D0%9A%D0%90_(%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F)) ( near-correct phonentic transliteration - TSCA).

## Overall intention:

With God's help and divine guidance achieving world peace in a continuous and evolutionary manner. Providing live-saving governable stability with migration paths for the concerned and influencing parties.
Stimulating industrial growth channels with mission guidelines.

## Reasoning:

https://past-the-war.earth/notes/future_projections-in_A_Better_World/Why_NLNM_and_not_just_Peace

## Target:

Realistic mass-participation simulation of NLNM (Non-Lethal, Non-Mutilating, No Serious Injury) tactical combat.

## Original inspiration:

"The year is 2128.  The new NLNM combat system has just been implemented but things are going horribly wrong.  Spain enlarges its platoons, Russians are taking their helmets off, and the East is a complete mess.  The UN house won't vote on the Europa migration pilot and we are losing sight of the goal.  You have been placed as the chief of staff of XYZ - the one country that is determined to get it done."

## Ideal resources:

Earnest time and effort of domain experts, project manager and specialists.

## Effort roadmap:

Phase 1: Tactical (boxing version) NLNM combat.

Phase 2: Tactical non-piloted mech warfare in separate engagements.
