It is intended to simulate tactical NLNM combat. It will have elements of external observation and aims for shared, en masse participation in simuations by cross-national, interested parties. 

Reasoning behind the project:

Realistic simulation of the NLNM (Non-Lethal, Non-Mutilating, No Serious Injury) warfare.

Inspirational statement (from original game-alike draft):

"The year is 2128.  The new NLNM combat system has just been implemented but things are going horribly wrong.  Spain enlarges its platoons, Russians are taking their helmets off, and the East is a complete mess.  The UN house won't vote on the Europa migration pilot and we are losing sight of the goal.  You have been placed as the chief of staff of XYZ - the one country that is determined to get it done."

Tactical (boxing version) NLNM combat.

Tactical non-piloted mech warfare in separate engagements.
