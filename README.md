Resulting phonentic association: TSCA

## Overall intention:

With God's help and divine guidance achieving world peace in a continuous and evolutionary manner. Encouraging live-saving governable stability with migration paths for the concerned and influencing parties.
Stimulating industrial growth channels with mission guidelines.

## Reasoning:

https://past-the-war.earth/notes/future_projections-in_A_Better_World/Why_NLNM_and_not_just_Peace

## Target:

Specification, regulations and implementation plan of NLNM (Non-Lethal, Non-Mutilating, No Serious Injury) tactical combat.  Realistic, cross-potential-opponent mass-participation simulation.

## Original inspiration:

"The year is 2128.  The new NLNM combat system has just been implemented but things are going horribly wrong.  Spain enlarges its platoons, Russians are taking their helmets off, and the East is a complete mess.  The UN house won't vote on the Europa migration pilot and we are losing sight of the goal.  You have been placed as the chief of staff of XYZ - the one country that is determined to get it done."

## Ideal contribution composition:

Earnest time and effort of domain experts, project manager and specialists.

## Roadmap:

[Plan Outline](./Plan_Outline.md)

### Phase 0.5

By 2028:

Create specificatioin, regulations and implementation plan.  Finish creating the required technology layer.  Gather artwork proposals.  Stretch goal: gather detailed 3D models for all opposing side combatant, armor and equipment variations.

### Phase 1

By Spring of 2031:

Create a limited, realistic simulation of tactical NLNM ground combat with command-only (Augmented Reality) controls at platoon and company commander level.

### Phase 2

By 2043

Create full mass participation tactical simulation of (training, enforced discipline and equipment controlled, up to battalion level) blunt impact NLNM combat in rural/unsettled areas.

(Parallel with sufficient contributor participation) create comparable tactical simulation of projectile and boarding naval NLNM combat.

### Phase 3

By 2067

Expand tactical simulation to regiment level.

Enable smart armor with massively-collaborative NLNM goal accomplishment capabilities.

### Additional Goal A

Multi-participant tactical simulation of remotely-piloted mech combat in industrial zones.

Multi-participant tactical simulation of modern projectile based NLNM combat in urban areas.

### Additional Goal 2

Remotely piloted surface-to-air NLNM and air-to-air NLNM combat.
