Resulting phonentic association: TSCA

## Overall intention:

With God's help and divine guidance achieving world peace in a continuous and evolutionary manner. Encouraging live-saving governable stability with migration paths for the concerned and influencing parties.
Stimulating industrial growth channels with mission guidelines.

## Reasoning:

https://past-the-war.earth/notes/future_projections-in_A_Better_World/Why_NLNM_and_not_just_Peace

## Target:

Realistic mass-participation simulation of NLNM (Non-Lethal, Non-Mutilating, No Serious Injury) tactical combat.

## Original inspiration:

"The year is 2128.  The new NLNM combat system has just been implemented but things are going horribly wrong.  Spain enlarges its platoons, Russians are taking their helmets off, and the East is a complete mess.  The UN house won't vote on the Europa migration pilot and we are losing sight of the goal.  You have been placed as the chief of staff of XYZ - the one country that is determined to get it done."

## Ideal contribution composition:

Earnest time and effort of domain experts, project manager and specialists.

## Product roadmap:

Phase 1: Multi-participant tactical simulation of (training, discipline and equipment controlled) blunt impact NLNM combat in rural/unsettled areas.

Phase 2 (parallel with Phase 1 with sufficient contributor participation): Multi-participant tactical simulation of projectile and boarding naval NLNM combat.

Phase 3: Multi-participant tactical simulation of remotely-piloted mech combat in industrial zones.

Phase 4: Multi-participant tactical simulation of modern projectile based NLNM combat in urban areas.

Phase 5: Add remotely piloted surface-to-air NLNM combat to Phase 3 and air-to-air NLNM combat.
