Lets envision the non-lethal future of warfare

The year is 2128.  The new non-lethal combat system has just been implemented but it's a complete mess.  Spain enlarges its platoons, Russians are taking their helmets off, and the East is a complete mess.  The UN house won't vote on the Europa migration pilot and we are losing sight of the goal.  You have been placed as the chief of staff of the XYZ - the one country that is determined to get things right.  Your team must:

Strategically move divisions and organize supply lines (Civ2)

Tactically lead your units in the regional and continental theaters (Warcraft).

Perform deterium coverage maneuvers on the sea (Pirates! Gold)

Build defensive fortifications (SIM City) and direct robotic battles for H3 control on the Moon (HMM3)

Map more asteriods than ABC (Space Quest)

Maintain channels of communication with counterparts - Civ diplomacy screens.
