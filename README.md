Lets envision the non-lethal, non-maiming future of warfare!

The year is 2128.  The new NLNM combat system has just been implemented but things are going horribly wrong.  Spain enlarges its platoons, Russians are taking their helmets off, and the East is a complete mess.  The UN house won't vote on the Europa migration pilot and we are losing sight of the goal.  You have been placed as the chief of staff of XYZ - the one country that is determined to get it done.  Your team must:

Strategically move divisions and organize supply lines (Civ2)

Tactically lead your units in the regional and join in continental theaters (Warcraft).

Perform deterium coverage maneuvers on the sea (Pirates! Gold)

Build defensive fortifications (SIM City) and direct robotic battles for H3 control on Moon's poles (HMM3)

Map more Earth bound asteriods than ABC (Space Quest)

Maintain channels of communication with the diplomatic core - Civ diplomacy screens.
